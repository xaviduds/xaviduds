# Hi

My name is Eduardo de Melo Xavier. I'm a Software Engineer at Preto no Branco (PNB).

I like Rust and Linux, see more in my [portfolio](https://portfolio-xaviduds-projects.vercel.app/).

I have one project called [Lince](https://github.com/lince-social/lince), I try to put every new idea inside it. It serves my needs of obsidian, todo, dotfiles, cron jobs, personal finance control, app opening and more. Working on adding Bevy for gamifying it and creating a game inside it.
